TODO:
activate things on times animation has occured

variable font? for the hero page / breathe directions?

reset button (fin)
\*50/50: Change the transition durations to a shorter time frame?
scroll snapping (fin)

make a dark mode (low prio)

fade-in for the background image should be slow then speed up (ease-in?)
keep moving box/directions (text in box) at high opacity

perhaps give the background image a chance of being a BG vid (mp4)

animation options:
(2) 'states'
Square spins and expands to fill outer square (no translates)

Gallery Figures:

<figure>
          <img src="" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption> 
        </figure>

04/05: create new animation (fin)
apply buttons to change animations (fin)

accessibility (close modal on esc-keypress)
**url input bar
**Option to choose # of cycles (fin)
\*\*\*\*Input Validation on #Iterations
make images (In gallery and on button) responsive to screen size (fin - media query)

Not immediate but good to have:
Expansion of gallery Grid to the right when full (with horizontal scroll snap)
pages 1 and 2 (intro page and animation have arrow-down animations)
create option to customize new text directions (instead of inhale, hold, exhale, hold)

Help tooltip on full file-path for new background image:

1. Any picture with full file path input is possible, just have the image extension (.jpg, .webp, png, etc) (http://, file:// etc)
2. you can get an image on your home pc by first opening that image in a browser then copying the full file path into app's input

First Prio:
New Fonts!
Style Concerns (box-shadows, button Styling)

Change the Gallery!
2 flex items: title & add image input
rest of page: grid gallery that flexes right to expand (with scroll snapping)
