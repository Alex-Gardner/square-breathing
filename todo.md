Create comprehensive readme
clean up todos

\*\*Options panel on horizontally aligned phones doesn't render well

TODO:

variable font? for the hero page / breathe directions?

make a dark mode (low prio)

perhaps give the background image a chance of being a BG vid (mp4)

Initial gallery pictures should be loaded from differing sources (srcset) based on screen size
\*\*\*\*Input Validation on #Iterations

accessibility (close modal on esc-keypress)

Not immediate but good to have:
pages 1 and 2 (intro page and animation have arrow-down animations)
create option to customize new text directions (instead of inhale, hold, exhale, hold)

Help tooltip on full file-path for new background image:

1. Any picture with full file path input is possible, just have the image extension (.jpg, .webp, png, etc) (http://, file:// etc)
2. you can get an image on your home pc by first opening that image in a browser then copying the full file path into app's input
